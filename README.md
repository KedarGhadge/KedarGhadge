### In Short
<details>
• I remember my programming started with the “Hello world” and addition’s code in C language and I started loving programming.</br>
• I never thought at initial days of my career that I would ever choose IT as my profession. As I belongs to the Electronics trade of engineering.</br>
• But while working in Production Industry also I did the many useful projects for company with using my coding skills, and I understood that my grasping power in programming is really better.</br>
• So, I made high budget projects in very low budget using Microsoft excel formulae and macro programming, it motivates me to start my journey in IT industry.</br>
• I have done the C-DAC and got my first IT job because of my Philomath and Enthusiastic nature</br>
• Even in my starting career days my attitude towards my work is the serious and focused as it is today.</br>
• I always try to find the automation to reduce the manual work and manual efforts on field, so making tools for it is always seems my plus point to me.</br>
• My micro habits like making documentation for customer fixes and writing a comment about the details in code helped me and my team mates while bug fixing and providing a enhancements to customer in timely manner. </br>
• Instead of only achieving targets in time, customer satisfaction was my main motive while working with any project. So that’s how I always loved my work.</br>
• And lastly I don’t like to advertise this fact, but other than curricular I always keep my self active in no curricular activities in company as well. Like trekking , mimicry, small acts or dancing.</br>
